                Hello. This is a website developed by Ben and Jadyn. We created this website because we needed to do a school project on Code.Org but we thought it would be fun to challenge ourselves. This website combines random ways to cook food and different foods
                for wacky combinations. This website shouldn't be taken seriously as a meal decider for you, as the meal combinations are typically absurd, although it is up to you if you would like a meal decision from this. We hope you enjoy your time
                on this website and look forward to more projects like this from us in the future.
            </p>
